2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Q_reg_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Q_reg_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin notQ_reg_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin notQ_reg_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Q_reg_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Q_reg_C/CLR, Q_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell notQ_reg_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) notQ_reg_C/CLR, notQ_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Q_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Q_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch notQ_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin notQ_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
